### Horned Beasts


#### Lab 01: 

- The goal of Lab 01 is to initialize a react application and to use react components to build the basic structure of a webage entirely with Javascript. To start, there is an app component that renders a header, footer, and main component.  The main component renders two horned beast components.  Each horned beast component renders a title, image, and description of the image.  


#### Lab 02:

- The goal of Lab 02 is to practice using state and props in a react application, to incorporate functions within react components, and to deploy react applications with Netlify.
